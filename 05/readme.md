# Day 5

I wanted to try using a silly programming language, but it seems that something like that won't happen. Oh well, gives me more chances to practice general-purpose programming languages.

The logic behind this was a bit difficult for me to figure out, but in the end I think I came up with a solution that I'm happy with.

(Side note: I don't see how TypeScript differs that much from JavaScript, but it's probably nicer for people to use. Being able to use async/await was nice, though.)
