# Day 7

~~I stayed up WAY too late for this, to be honest.~~

I think that being funny with my programming languages is fun and all that, but I can use this time better as a way to improve my skills with existing languages. I decided to bust out C++ again for today since it's a language that I do enjoy and want to understand more intimately. I tried to make use of C++'s standard library with things like smart pointers and vectors and whatnot - it wasn't too bad. What was too bad was the fact that I misread the prompt for part 2 and was inputting the smallest directory's name instead of the smallest directory's size. That took two hours too long. (At least I had the correct answer right in front of me before I looked for solutions.)

The code you see is slightly cleaned up - I rewrote part B to not require a massive vector and instead used pass-by-reference variables. It's more elegant and would have been a lot easier for me at least.
